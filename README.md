# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
We were given a data set from a Colorado election. We were tasked to do the following leveraging python:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
During our analysis, we used our python code to asnwer the following:
	
	* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
		* There were a total of 369,711 votes cast in this election.
	
	* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
		* The number of votes and the percentage of total votes are as follows:
			* Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
			* Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
			* Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
	
	* Which county had the largest number of votes?
		* Denver
	
	* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
		* Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
		* Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes.
		* Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 votes.
	
	*Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
		* Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script provides a quick and accurate breakdown of the election results for Colorado; however, with 2 slight modifications it could be leveraged for any election. They are as follows:

	1. We could modify the script to look at the popularity of each candidate by county. This could help future candidates focus on those areas based off of their political stance.
	
	2. We could modify the code to take a larger data set that would pull in every county in the state. This would allow for a more hollistic view of the outcome.
